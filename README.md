Solutions to the exercises in _How to Design Programs_
=======================================================

These are entirely written by me, so don't cry if they don't sound good to you. Fork it and fix it or leave it.

You can always write programs with shorter variable names (like how most Lisp code I've seen has been written) and reduce the number of definitions. But I've stuck to my style of using clear variable names and introduced procedures whereever possible.

The style in these solutions are mostly written from a perspective of a scheme beginner. So the programs in the earlier exercises may sound bad if you learn some extra syntactic sugar in the current exercise.
